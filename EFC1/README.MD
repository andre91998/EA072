## Linear Regression for MNIST Database (Q1)
  Here we have a linear classification model. The inputs are MNIST 28x28 matrices which are stacked into vector with size 784. All the samples then form the collumns of the data matrix X, where the first collumn is a fixed polarizing input collumn of ones. The output is calculated multiplyiing X by W, where W is the parameter matrix (785x10) which can be obtained through least squares regression. What we want is: !(https://github.com/andre91998/EA072/blob/master/EFC1/min.PNG) where y is the output matrix from the training data. We then obtain that, since we cannot guarantee that X has a complete rank, !(https://github.com/andre91998/EA072/blob/master/EFC1/W.PNG).
